## Welcome to Lightstream

Lightstream is your cloud-native data streaming solution, harnessing the power of cloud storage for seamless, reliable data processing.

### Introduction

Traditional frameworks like Kafka often face operational challenges due to the need for data replication across brokers for reliability. Lightstream takes a different approach by directly utilizing cloud storage—such as S3 and Google Cloud—as the primary storage layer. This eliminates the complexities associated with managing and maintaining replicated data across different brokers.

#### Key Features

- **Cloud Storage Reliability**: Lightstream places the burden of storage reliability on cloud storage, leveraging the robust capabilities of platforms like S3 and Google Cloud.

- **Stateless Agents**: Lightstream's "brokers" are stateless agents designed to efficiently batch incoming data into smaller units, pushing them directly to cloud storage in a custom file format.

- **Compaction for Efficiency**: Small files are intelligently compacted to create larger, more efficient files. This optimization enhances the streaming experience for data consumers.

### Challenges with Traditional Approaches

Traditional streaming frameworks like Kafka introduce operational challenges related to data replication and broker management. These challenges often require significant effort in terms of maintenance and infrastructure scaling.

#### Stateless Agents: A Solution

Lightstream addresses these challenges through the introduction of stateless agents. These agents simplify the streaming process by efficiently batching data and pushing it to cloud storage, eliminating the need for complex data replication strategies. This not only streamlines the operational aspects but also enhances the overall reliability and efficiency of the streaming pipeline.

Explore Lightstream, embrace the simplicity of cloud-native data streaming, and contribute to a more resilient and scalable data processing future!
